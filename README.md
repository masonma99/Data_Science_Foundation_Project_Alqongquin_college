## Background and Business Task 
In this task, we were given a dataset that contains patientsâ€™ information (demographics and medical data) that relates to heart disease prediction. In this assignment, 
we are required to perform the following tasks and answer questions to obtain insights about the data and to conduct predictive modeling to forecastthe presence of 
heart failure (variable HeartDisease).

## Tools
1. EDA (Exploratory data analysis;
2. Data visualizaiton;
3. KNN, SVM, Decision Tree and GridSearchCV to find the best estimators;
4. Plot the ROC graph to compare the performance

## Dataset
Attached with this Jupyter notebook.
